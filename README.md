# Chinese MNIST Image Classifier

A project for classifying Chinese characters using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset used for training and testing contains images of handwritten Chinese characters.

## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying handwritten Chinese characters. The dataset consists of images of Chinese characters written by different individuals. The model is trained using a CNN architecture to learn features from the images and classify them into their respective classes.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN architecture for image classification.
- Supports classification of a wide range of Chinese characters.
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy for assessing model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chinese-mnist.git
cd chinese-mnist
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Place your training and testing images in the appropriate directories.
2. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

4. Make predictions:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```
